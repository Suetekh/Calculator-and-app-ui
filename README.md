# Flutter Calculator with Navigation

This Flutter project demonstrates a calculator application integrated with tab-based navigation and a navigation drawer. The app includes SignIn, SignUp, and Calculator screens, each accessible via tabs or the navigation drawer.

## Features
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Easily switch between SignIn, SignUp, and Calculator screens using the bottom navigation bar.
- **Navigation Drawer**: Access the same screens through a convenient navigation drawer with a slide-out animation.
- **Calculator Functionality**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a responsive UI.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Active and inactive tabs with different appearances.
